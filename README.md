# 🧠 Python Basics Projects - Learning Python Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Python projects I created as part of the **first phase of my AI learning roadmap**, which focuses on mastering the **fundamentals of the Python programming language**.

Rather than just reading or watching tutorials, I chose to review the core concepts by **building real, practical projects**. Each project was intentionally more challenging than the previous one, helping me gradually strengthen my understanding and problem-solving skills.

## Completed Projects:

1. 🧮 **Simple Calculator**
   - Performs basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
   - Uses user input and conditional statements

2. 🎲 **Guess the Number Game**
   - Generates a random number between 1 and 100
   - Uses loops and conditions to guide user guesses

3. ✊✋✌️ **Rock Paper Scissors Game**
   - Implements basic game logic using randomness and user input
   - Compares player choice against computer choice

4. ✅ **To-Do List Application**
   - Manages a list of tasks
   - Supports adding, viewing, and deleting tasks

5. 📇 **Contact Manager**
   - Uses lists and dictionaries to manage contacts
   - Supports saving and loading from a JSON file
   - Allows adding, viewing, searching, and deleting contacts

## Skills Acquired in This Phase:

- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- Looping constructs (`while`, `for`)
- Handling user input (`input`, `print`)
- Working with lists and dictionaries
- Creating and calling functions
- Reading and writing data to files (JSON)
- Organizing code and files into project folders

## What's Next?

I’m now moving on to the **second phase** of my AI learning journey, which includes:

- Learning data analysis foundations
- Working with the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries
- Visualizing data using `matplotlib`

I’ll continue building new projects and documenting them here on GitHub.
